ALX Simple Shell Team Project
This is an ALX collaboration project on Shell. We were tasked to create a simple shell that mimics the Bash shell. Our shell shall be called hsh

Project was completed using
C language
Shell
Betty linter

General Requirement for project
All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
Use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
Shell should not have any memory leaks
No more than 5 functions per file
All header files should be include guarded
Write a README with the description of the project

Description
hsh is a simple UNIX command language interpreter that reads commands from either a file or standard input and executes them.

How hsh works
Prints a prompt and waits for a command from the user
Creates a child process in which the command is checked
Checks for built-ins, aliases in the PATH, and local executable programs
The child process is replaced by the command, which accepts arguments
When the command is done, the program returns to the parent process and prints the prompt
The program is ready to receive a new command
To exit: press Ctrl-D or enter "exit" (with or without a status)
Works also in non interactive mode

Compilation
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh

GitHub
There should be one project repository per group. If you clone/fork/whatever a project repository with the same name before the second deadline, you risk a 0% score.

More Info
Output
Unless specified otherwise, your program must have the exact same output as sh (/bin/sh) as well as the exact same error output.
The only difference is when you print an error, the name of the program must be equivalent to your argv[0] (See below)
Example of error with sh:

$ echo "qwerty" | /bin/sh
/bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found
$ echo "qwerty" | /bin/../bin/sh
/bin/../bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found
$

Same error with your program hsh:

$ echo "qwerty" | ./hsh
./hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
$ echo "qwerty" | ./././hsh
./././hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
$

Testing
Your shell should work like this in interactive mode:

$ ./hsh
($) /bin/ls
hsh main.c shell.c
($)
($) exit
$

But also in non-interactive mode:

$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
$
$ cat test_ls_2
/bin/ls
/bin/ls
$
$ cat test_ls_2 | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
$
